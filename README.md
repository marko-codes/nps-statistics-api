# nps-statistics-api

 Backend for NPS Statistics
 This is built having in mind SAAS business model. 
 Idea was to have one api entry for gathering data from surveys. 
 Then our nps service pops in and create all the necessary data tables with statistics, the idea of this is after every quarter with scheduler we setup our services   to do the job of creating quarterly statistics and then these data can be fetched and displayed on frontend.
